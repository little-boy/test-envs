## Branches
- tp-env-1 : play with a package manager & make a test
  1) Add a package that allow us to log stuff : https://github.com/Delgan/loguru
  2) Start logging stuff in the app
  3) In `utils/file_viewer.py`, at "log here", log something meaningful with an error level.
  4) Complete the FileViewer tests (`tests/test_file_viewer.py`), running tests with `python3 -m unittest`
  5) Now, if it hasn't been done, (unit) test that the error level has been correctly done. (from step (3))
  6) (bonus) Rewrite tests with pytest : https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.4.x/getting-started.html : is that better ? why ?
